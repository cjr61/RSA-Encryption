Project 1 Part 2

Written in C++

Make sure this project exists within a folder with the sha256 files from Dr. Duan's website. This folder needs to be in the same location as the bigInt435 folder to use its methods. The BigInt435 class needs to be compiled so that all of the .o files are available for use by the program. A makefile is provided. Use make all to compile. Tested in a linux based terminal  on mac.
